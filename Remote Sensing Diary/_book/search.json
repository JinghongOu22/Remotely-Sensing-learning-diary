    "text": "1.1 Summary\nThe content of this week mainly outlines the content of the remoting sensing course from the aspects of passive and active sensor, data format type of remoting sensing, and data resolution type. Sensors are mainly divided into two types: passive and active. Both of them process the collected electromagnetic waves, with the difference that passive waves are collected from sources such as the sun, while active waves are collected from waves reflected after the sensor actively emits them. The data format is mainly divided into two aspects: raster and LiDAR, and raster is the main data type in this field. Resolution is divided into four aspects: spectral, spatial, temporal, and radiometric.\n\n\n\nSummary of introduction lecture (made by author, 2023)\n\n\nRegarding sensors, they are mainly mounted on platforms such as satellites, planes, drones, phones, and other handheld devices (1?). Common sensors include ultraviolet remote sensing sensors, visible light remote sensing sensors, infrared remote sensing sensors, and microwave remote sensing sensors (2?). Among these types of remote sensing sensors, common devices include cameras, scanners, multispectral cameras, etc., and common devices in microwave remote sensing sensors include radiometers, altimeters, real aperture radars, and synthetic aperture radars. In the following, I will mainly introduce my learning about the application of synthetic aperture radar."

    "text": "1.2 SAR application\nSAR data consist of high-resolution reflected returns of radar-frequency energy from terrain that has been illuminated by a directed beam of pulses generated by the sensor. The radar returns from the terrain are mainly determined by the physical characteristics of the surface features (such as surface roughness, geometric structure, and orientation), the electrical characteristics (dielectric constant, moisture content, and conductivity), and the radar frequency of the sensor. By supplying its own source of illumination, the SAR sensor can acquire data day or night without regard to cloud cover (3?).\nOne of the limitations of working with SAR data has been the somewhat tedious preprocessing steps that lower-level SAR data requires. Depending on the type of analysis you want to do, these preprocessing steps can include: applying the orbit file, radiometric calibration, de-bursting, multilooking, speckle filtering, and terrain correction (4?)."
